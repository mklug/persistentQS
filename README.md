# persistentQS

Fully persistent pure python stack and queue implementation can be found in the respective directories.  Implementations of partially persistent stacks and dynamical arrays can be found in the ``Partially`` directory.  The queue implementation follows that paired-list approach mentioned in ["Simple and efficient purely functional queues and deques"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/simple-and-efficient-purely-functional-queues-and-deques/7B3036772616B39E87BF7FBD119015AB) by Okasaki.
