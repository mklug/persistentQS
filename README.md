# persistentQS

Fully persistent pure python stack and queue implementation can be found in the respective directories.  Implementations of partially persistent stacks and dynamical arrays can be found in the ``Partially`` directory.  The queue implementation follows that paired-list approach mentioned in "Simple and efficient purely functional queues and deques" by Okasaki.
